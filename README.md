# Red-Wine-Quality-Analysis
Red wine is a drink enjoyed by millions of people globally. From wine makers to wine connoisseurs, red wine has notched positive accolades for its numerous benefits, be it healthwise or pure economical gains. The red wine I intend to assess its quality  is from the Vinho Verde Portugese variety of  grapes.

1 - fixed acidity: most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile (do not evaporate readily)

2 - volatile acidity: the amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste

3 - citric acid: found in small quantities, citric acid can add ‘freshness’ and flavor to wines

4 - residual sugar: the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, it’s rare to find wines with less than 1 gram/liter and wines with greater than 45 grams/liter are considered sweet

5 - chlorides: the amount of salt in the wine

6 - free sulfur dioxide: the free form of SO2SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion; it prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine

7 - total sulfur dioxide: amount of free and bound forms of S02S02; in low concentrations, SO2SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine

8 - density: the density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content

9 - pH: describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale

10 - sulphates: a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02S02) levels, wich acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant

11 - alcohol: the percent alcohol content of the wine

Output variable (based on sensory data):
12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)


Conclusion:

The main physicochemical attributes that lower the quality of red wine are:
1.	Fixed acidity.
2.	Citric acidity.

The main physicochemical attributes that  increase the quality of red wine are:
1.	Residual sugar.
2.	Alcohol.
